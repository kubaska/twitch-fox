## About missing features

You probably noticed that Twitch Fox v5 is missing some big features. This is because Twitch "new" Helix API is a massive downgrade in about every aspect: huge content cuts and many inconsistencies that shouldn't get past QA stage.

Below is the list of user submitted ideas that community can vote for in order for Twitch to consider adding/bringing back. You'll need to login with your Twitch account.\
(Note: Voting for an idea will e-mail you updates on it. You can turn them off by going to Settings in top navigation.)
